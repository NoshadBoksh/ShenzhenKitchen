## üé® Changing Colors

### Understanding the Color System

The website uses **Tailwind CSS** color classes. Colors look like this:
- `text-amber-500` = amber/gold text
- `bg-amber-600` = amber/gold background
- `border-amber-500` = amber/gold border

### Available Colors

Replace `amber` with any of these:
- `red` - Red
- `emerald` - Green  
- `blue` - Blue
- `purple` - Purple
- `pink` - Pink
- `orange` - Orange
- `yellow` - Yellow
- `gray` - Gray

The number (500, 600, etc.) controls darkness:
- 400 = lighter
- 500 = medium
- 600 = darker
- 700 = very dark

### Where to Change Colors

1. **Main Accent Color (currently gold/amber)**
   - Search for `amber` in all files
   - Replace with your chosen color
   - Example: `text-amber-500` ‚Üí `text-emerald-500`

2. **Button Colors**
   - `components/hero.tsx` (lines 46-56)
   - `components/navbar.tsx` (line 71)
   - Change `bg-amber-600` to your color

3. **Background Colors**
   - Currently black (`bg-black`)
   - Change to: `bg-gray-900` (dark gray), `bg-zinc-900` (charcoal), etc.
